# Range function pattern is Range( start , stop , step )
# If we didn't give value to the 'start' segment ----(Considered as zero)----
# Stop segment is mandatory
# Step segment is optional --(Default is 1)---


# i , is print the value from the start default zero to the given range
for i in  range(10):
    print(i)
    print('Hai')
# Using for loop without accessing sequence items
